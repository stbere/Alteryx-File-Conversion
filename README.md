# Alteryx-File-Conversion
I could not find a tool to convert the the .yxzp, .yxmd and .yxmc files for Alteryx, so I wrote this Python script that converts them to JSON

Directions: add Alteryx files into the folder that contains the Python script and run the following command. Remember to change "path/to/directory" with the actual path of where your files are located. MUST be in the same folder as the Python script.

python batch_convert_alteryx_files_to_json.py "path/to/directory" "path/to/directory"
